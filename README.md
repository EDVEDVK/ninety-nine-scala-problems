# ninety-nine-scala-problems
Skeleton code and test suites for Phil Gold's [S99: Ninety-Nine Scala Problems](http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/). This is an SBT project containing all code snippets from the S99 website as well as tests covering all problems.

__Instructions__

Clone it, solve the problems, and fill in the missing implementations details to make all tests pass.
    
    sbt test

__Notes__

The code adheres mostly to Phil's code snippets with a few exceptions. Some changes were made because they were
necessary (new Scala version), some improved clarity or conciseness. Also, added missing code for the puzzles section.

Uses [Scala 2.11](http://www.scala-lang.org/news/2.11.7/), [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/),
and [ScalaTest](http://www.scalatest.org/).

__Contributions__

Contributions to improve tests or code snippets are welcome via GitHub issues or pull requests.

__Solutions__

You find my solution attempts on the [`solutions`](https://github.com/jayho/ninety-nine-scala-problems/tree/solutions) branch.
