# ninety-nine-scala-problems
A convenient starting point for Phil Gold's [S99: Ninety-Nine Scala Problems](http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/).

An SBT based project containing the skeleton scala code (taken from the snippets found on the S99 website) and test coverage for all problems.

__Instructions__

Clone it and run the following to see most tests failing:
    
    sbt test

Now it's time to activate those brain cells and fill in the missing implementations to make all tests pass.

__Notes__

The code is based on Phil's snippets with some minor and a few bigger changes.

Uses [Scala 2.11](http://www.scala-lang.org/news/2.11.7/), [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/),
and [ScalaTest](http://www.scalatest.org/).

__Contributions__

Contributions are welcome via GitHub issues or pull requests.

__Solutions__

You find my solution attempts on the [`solutions`](https://github.com/jayho/ninety-nine-scala-problems/tree/solutions) branch.
