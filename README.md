# ninety-nine-scala-problems
Skeleton code and test suites for Phil Gold's [S99: Ninety-Nine Scala Problems](http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/).

The idea is to have all the code in place to start working on S99 right away, inlcuding comprehensive test coverage to verify the solutions.

__Instructions__

* Clone it and impress your friends by making all tests pass
* Master branch is only for test coverage and skeleton code
* Uses [Scala 2.11](http://www.scala-lang.org/news/2.11.7/), [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/), and [ScalaTest](http://www.scalatest.org/) 

__Comments__

I adhered mostly to Phil's skeleton code, however I made some changes or added my own when it was either necessary (due to the newer Scala version), when it looked cleaner to me, or when there was no code provided (e.g. in the puzzles section).

__Contributions__

Contributions via GitHub pull requests to improve _individual tests, test coverage, or skeleton code_ are gladly accepted.
