# ninety-nine-scala-problems
Skeleton code and test suites for Phil Gold's [S99: Ninety-Nine Scala Problems](http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/) which are a great way to learn Scala.

The intention is to have all the code in place to start working on S99 right away, and to have comprehensive test coverage to verify your solutions.

I tried to stick mostly to Phil's skeleton code, however I made some amendmends when it was necessary to work with a newer Scala version, or when it made sense to me.

__Instructions__

* Clone it and hack away until all tests pass :-)
* Master branch is only for test coverage and skeleton code
* Uses [Scala 2.11](http://www.scala-lang.org/news/2.11.1/), [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/), and [ScalaTest](http://www.scalatest.org/) 

Tests are still incomplete and sometimes weak, but overall this should be a good starting point.

__Contributions__

Contributions via GitHub pull requests to improve _individual tests, test coverage, or skeleton code_ are gladly accepted from their original author.
