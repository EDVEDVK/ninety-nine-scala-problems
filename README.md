# ninety-nine-scala-problems
Skeleton code and test suites for Phil Gold's [S99: Ninety-Nine Scala Problems](http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/).

The idea is to have an SBT project prepared with all code snippets from the S99 website including tests covering all problems.

__Instructions__

Clone it, run the tests, then hack away and fill in the missing implementations to make them all pass.
    
    sbt test

__Notes__

The code adheres mostly to Phil's code snippets with a few exceptions. Some changes were made because they were necessary (new Scala version), some improved clarity or conciseness. Also, added missing code for the puzzles section.

Uses [Scala 2.11](http://www.scala-lang.org/news/2.11.7/), [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/), and [ScalaTest](http://www.scalatest.org/).

__Contributions__

Contributions via GitHub issues or pull requests to improve tests or skeleton code are welcome. No solutions please :)
